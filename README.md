### Idea of the program

This program is aimed to the visualization of the **length dillation** effect as seen from a moving inertial frame of reference. This can be done if we compare the evolution in time of the positions calculated by galileo's velocity addition law, wich governs Newton's mechanics, with the relativistic addition velocity law. To compare, we'll plot 3D graphs.

The left image represents the movement of a particle as seen from the stationary reference frame. The other image, is the trajectory of the particle as seen from a moving reference frame, which moves to the right of the stationary frame. As we can see, if we calculate the trajectory of the particle as seen from the moving frame, using Newtonian mechanics and relativistic mechanics, there's a difference in length, because of the length dillation.

### Why I did this?

Well, I'm not a professional programmer, but I'd like to be. So I'm trying to implement some applicantions using Python.

### Next steps?

Maybe I'll try to turn this program in a real executable software, so I'll have to learn how to make a GUI. Also, I could implement this algorithm in a website, probably using javascript (I'm learning web development).[^1]
